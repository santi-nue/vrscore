# Virtual Radar Server

A .NET Core application for Windows, Linux and macOS that can decode Mode-S and
ADS-B transmissions from aircraft transponders and plot their positions on a
map.

This is in the very early stages of development. The mature version of VRS is

## Compilation

You will need the .NET 8 SDK, available here:

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0

Confirm that you have a .NET Core 8 SDK installed:

| Operating System | Command |
| ---              | --- |
| All              | `dotnet --list-sdks` |

To build everything:

| Operating System | Command |

| Linux            | `./build.sh solution` |
| macOS            | `./build.sh solution` |
| Windows          | `build solution` |

To build and run the server:

| Operating System | Command |
| ---              | --- |
| Linux            | `./build.sh server -run` |
| macOS            | `./build.sh server -run` |

To just run the server without building first:
